## General Information
- An US based company wants to understand the factors which effects the bike sharing demand so they can grow revenue after the corona pandamic. 
- Company want to build a Model so they can understand feature that contributes towards demand in bike sharing.
- Company will be using past data from 2018 and 2019
- For this case study we will be building a Linear Regression Model to know the important features that contributes towards Demand in Bike Sharing


## Conclusions
- From EDA, we could conclude that Temperature, Season and Month-Year contributes most towards the demand
- Different Models were tried to get the best model
- Final Model includes 8 features
- FInal Model was able to explain 80% variance in data on Train set and 76% on Test set


## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Libraries - Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels, sweetviz
- Jupyter Notebook
